(1) download or connect to https://github.com/pmarcum/LaTex-Formatting and select the
    set of files (aas-style or general) that meet your situation, you can either download the files or link
    Overleaf to the needed files in the GitHub repository through URL, and then add the following to
    the preamble of your main paper
\usepackage{FUpackages}
\usepackage{FUformatting}
\usepackage{FUnewCommands} % not needed by WorPT files but generally useful

(2) copy/paste the following into the main latex file where you want to put this section of text (it is not a table), and then uncomment the below lines by removing the first percent sign at the beginning of the line
    IMPORTANT SHORTCUT:  You can toggle commenting / un-commenting across multiple lines within Overleaf by mouse-selecting the desired block of lines to un-comment (or comment), and then hitting: control slash ( [Ctrl] / )   ... or ...  command slash  ([command] /)  for a PC or Mac, resp.
    (Note that lines that should remain commented-out in the below block have 2 percent signs ... the first will be removed when you uncomment the whole block, but the second percent sign will remain as intended to retain that line as a true comment within the Latex document.)
 > > > > > > > > > > > > > < < < < < < < < < < < < < <
 Block of code to be uncommented by removing the *first* percent-sign at the beginning of the following lines below (leave intentional comments with at least 1 percent sign to keep them commented!)
 The next couple of lines define cell and font colors that can be changed if desired (keep this comment line commented-out!)
\def\BannerColor{Blue} % Color of the banner at the top "Equipment, Travel, Supplies, Page Charges"
\def\BannerFontColor{White} % Color of the text in the banner at the top "Equipment, Travel, Supplies, Page Charges"
\def\BannerBoldface#1{\textbf{#1}} % Bold-face the banner at the top "Equipment, Travel, Supplies, Page Charges"; to remove boldface, replace {\textbf{#1}} with {#1} or with other desired mark-up
\def\CostLabelColor{Blue} % Color of the "Cost Category" column label
\def\YearLabelColor{Blue} % Color of the "Y1", "Y2", etc  column labels
\def\TotalLabelColor{Blue} % Color of the "Total" column label
\def\ColumnBoldface#1{\textbf{#1}} % Bold-face the "Cost Category" and "Y1, Y2, ..." column labels; to remove boldface, replace {\textbf#1} with {#1} or with other desired mark-up
\def\TotalBoldface#1{\textbf{#1}} % Bold-face the "Total ..." column label; to remove boldface, replace {\textbf{#1}} with {#1} or with other desired mark-up
\def\fmtA#1{\textbf{#1}} % Format for listed budget items (except for Travel's "domestic" and "international" break-out lines); to remove boldface, replace {\textbf{#1}} with {#1} or with other desired mark-up
\def\fmtB#1{\textit{#1}} % Format for the Travel's "domestic" and "international" items;  to remove, replace {\textit{#1}} with {#1} or with other desired mark-up
\def\fmtC#1{\textbf{#1}} % Format for all budget amounts not under "Total" and not in the Travel's "domestic" and "international" break-outs; to remove boldface, replace {\textbf{#1}} with {#1} or with other desired mark-up
\def\fmtD#1{\textit{#1}} % Format of budget amounts under the Travel's "domestic" and "international" break-outs that are not Total values; to remove format, replace {\textit{#1}} with {#1} or with other desired mark-up
\def\fmtE#1{\textbf{#1}} % Format of budget amounts under Total that are not in the "Domestic" and "International" break-outs; to remove boldface, replace {\textbf{#1}} with {#1} or with other desired mark-up
\def\fmtF#1{\textit{#1}} % Format of budget amounts under Total that are also under the "Domestic" or "International" break-outs; to remove format, replace {\textit{#1}} with {#1} or with other desired mark-up

Table\,\ref{tab:isANONnonlabor} shows rolled-up values for travel costs and other non-labor costs. Travel cost details, including costing assumptions used, are presented in Table\,\ref{tab:isANONtravel}.

      \textbf{Notes and assumptions}:
      \newline \newline
      {\color{red} \underline{\scshape{Equipment Costs}}: In Yrs~1-2, we request a total of \$11K for the purchase of a laptop
  and associated IT equipment to replace the PI's aging laptop (purchased in 2018, well past nominal 4-year refresh cycle at the time of the proposed budget period),
 ``NASA-tized'' computer equipment (laptops, monitors) for use by the summer interns, and as an ``emergency'' fund, should the Science~PI's $\sim$3-yr old laptop fail or need repair.}\newline \newline
      \underline{\scshape{Travel}}: refer to Table\,\ref{tab:isANONtravel}. \newline \newline
      {\color{red} \underline{\scshape{Publication Costs}}: Our work plan includes the publication of four key manuscripts: (see Table \ref{tab:NOTANONschedule} for details),
 but given the student projects, we have budgeted for 8 papers. We request a total of \$2K for publication costs,  using the assumption
  that the papers will fall between "Tier 1" and "Tier 2" categories as defined in ApJ/AJ guidelines. These fees are included in proposed budget.}\newline \newline
      {\color{red}\underline{\scshape{ Materials and Supplies}}: We request an annually-averaged budget of \$1,125 to cover purchase of disk space to back up our data products and miscellaneous office and IT supplies at PI and Science-PI home institution.
  The distribution of these funds is top-heavy at the beginning of the grant period, when such supplies will be needed most. The disk size of the data products will be approximately ~39~Gb per exposure: four \texttt{float32} extensions per CCD,
   corresponding to the \textbf{1)} Zodiacal-CIB background, \textbf{2)} in-field, and \textbf{3)} out-field stray-light, and \textbf{4)} thermal emission layers, plus one \texttt{binary} extension for the Solar System object trails (\emph{streak / no streak}), for a total of 18~4096$\times$4096 detector focal plane.
   Storage of these products will not be required, as they will be immediately produced by the pipeline on a exposure-by-exposure basis. End-to-end simulations shall not exceed 100~Gb, and they will be accessible to the community through a public internet server.
    Publication~IV will require the analysis of an area equivalent to 32 adjacent field of views, the equivalent of a sector of the \RST/WFI High Latitude Wide Area Survey,
   which corresponds to 128 exposures. Assuming an average exposure size of 9~Gb, plus $\sim$40~Gb for the background products, we project that we will require $\sim$10--15~Tb of disk space (including backups).}}
